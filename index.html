                <p>EIMU is the first Estonian plant based milk provider that we got a chance to collaborate with wile working on this assignment. First step of the project was to identify client's needs and plan the scope of work. We divided our work into 3 different areas related to EIMU's online presence: improving the <b>visual identity</b>, creating a new <b>web platform</b> and planing the <b> social media strategy</b>. When working on visual identity we conducted market, sender and <b>user research</b> to find out what works the best and what the users like visually. Based on the results we created <b>brand style guide</b> which helped us to keep a coherent visual identity. When creating the web platform we found a lot of inspiration during the desk research. The scope of work included  drawing <b>wireframes</b>, creating <b>advanced prototype</b> and finally <b>coding</b> the solution.  Lastly we created a social media strategy including mock-up posts with our illustrations. </p>

                <p>This project was a group assignment in which we got a chance to collaborate with Silfen- a Danish accessory brand. The client wanted to improve their <b>online presence</b> as well as introduce the a new sub-brand to the website. We started with conducting <b>research</b> to find out which parts of the current solution could be improved. After identifying the main problems we started the ideation process, we used <b>personas</b> to keep the design as <b>user centred</b> as possible. Next step was <b>prototyping</b> starting with wireframes moving to more advanced prototype in Adobe XD. Last step was to code the final solution, we used github as our collaboration tool, we also needed to create a <b>database</b> to be able to display the products. At the end of we got a chance to prepare the final <b>pitch deck</b> and present our solution to the client. </p>

The first step was to prepare the images to be interactive and edit them in Photoshop and Illustrator. Next step was to work on the visual side and create a prototype of the webpage. After that we could code the static parts of the website and The final step was to <b>fetch the SVG </b> and make the website dynamic using JavaScript.<b> Web animations </b>helped us to make all of the transitions smooth and to make the configurator more <b>user-friendly</b>. </p>

                 We needed to create a <b>form</b> for Ezone website that will allow the users to join the e-sports community and get access to personalised content and articles regarding gaming performance. The first steps were to identify what information do we need to know about the user and plan how to create <b>engaging user interface</b>. We started designing the form by creating the prototype and dividing the fields into several steps to make the <b>user experience</b>user experience as pleasant and intuitive as possible. We created a <b>database</b> and connected it to the form in HTML using JavaScript. Last step was to style the form and all of the input fields using SASS, as well as add animations to make it more dynamic.</p>

                <p>The prupose of this project was to create an interactive, animated game from scratch. The process started with choosing style of the game, creating a <b>moodborad</b> and <b>style tile</b>. Next step was to create a character as well as <b>user interface</b> (consisting of 4 different game screens), based on the first sketches I created multiple <b>vector graphics</b>. Final step was coding the game and using the elements created in Illustrator. I created <b>activity diagram</b> to plan the structure of the code and based on that worked on the final solution. </p>

It included <b>creating logo, coherent UI design and brand values</b>. Our research showed a lot of young people seem to care for brand values & environmental impact, so it would be reasonable to create a perfect basic T-shirt brand with minimal carbon footprint, also transparent use of fabrics & manufacturing. We came up with an idea to create customizable T-shirts as well as a possibility to have a custom size. We made a T-shirt quiz, which could recommend the perfect T-shirt based on customers' personality & lifestyle.  </p>

                  a bar created for the purpose of this assignment. We were provided with a complex dynamic data structure showing the details of the products that they’re selling as well as keeping the track of the current orders and inventory. One of the team members and I were responsible for a dashboard showing the current state of the bar. Our goal was to create a coherent playful design using vibrant colours make the product as user friendly as possible and build a dynamic, responsive dashboard for the bartenders and bar managers using Vanilla JavaScript. </p>
